How to contribute
=================

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide:

Getting Started
---------------

-  Make sure you have a GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/signup/free/" target="_blank">Github</a>
-  Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
-  Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
-  Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
-  Fork the repository on GitHub

Making Changes
--------------

-  Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
-  This is usually the master branch.
-  Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on
   that branch.
-  To quickly create a topic branch based on master;
   ``git branch fix/master/my_contribution master`` then checkout
   the new branch with ``git checkout fix/master/my_contribution``.
   Please avoid working directly on the ``master`` branch.
-  Make commits of logical units.
-  Follow our `coding style`.
-  Check again your code to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

Submitting Changes
------------------

-  Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
-  Submit a pull request to the repository.
