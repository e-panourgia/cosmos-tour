# Welcome to the Universe

The purpose of this repository is to get familiar with Git and GitHub's concepts, and practice some basic commands. In addition, the project aims to provide a brief guided tour of the cosmos by the [Department of Management Science and Technology][1] of the [Athens University of Economics and Business][2].

**First of all:** Send your GitHub username to [Zoe][3] (if you have not shared it already), and expect an invitation to join as a repository collaborator.

## Tasks
- Clone this repository.
- Add interesting aspects of the cosmos to the **guide.md** file. (Create the file if it does not already exist.)
- Contribute generously and in several categories.
- In case you reuse other people's material, make sure to:
    1. rephrase the content, and
    2. add a reference to the original source.
- Introduce new categories and organize things.
- Feel free to add images and videos.
- You may modify, fix, or improve existing content added by others.
- Commit your changes.
- Push to the GitHub repository. (If needed, pull and resolve any merge conflicts.)
- Since you are a repository collaborator, you are not requested to follow the fork and pull request practice.

**DEADLINE: 3 April 2022 23:55**

## Tips
- Copy-pasting text is considered plagiarism, so make sure to rephrase any reused content.
- Configure your editor to use a spellchecker (in case you have not already done so).
- Include links where necessary (*e.g.,* books, online videos, *etc.*).
- Rearrange text if you think it should be organized differently&mdash;refactoring is always welcome!
- You can include images and videos, but don't forget to commit and push them.
- Images and videos should be placed in the ```media/``` directory. (Create the directory if it does not already exist.)
- Again, use references for images and videos&mdash;you cannot reuse web content without citing the original source.
- Be creative! Take it a step further by including a file with guidelines to contributing for newcomers, a code of conduct file, a license, *etc.*

## Grading System
- Number and quality of contributions&mdash;the more and the higher the quality the better!
- Each commit should include one contribution or a group of similar contributions.
- Do not combine several diverse contributions in one commit!
- Completeness of each contribution: one-sentence contributions are considered "bad" contributions.
- Breaking things (*e.g.*, merge conflicts) comes with a grade deduction.
- But fixing others' breaks (*e.g.*, resolving merge conflicts) has a bonus!
- Quality of commit messages: they should be descriptive (of the change), concise, and follow best practices (*e.g.*, by [Robert Painsi][4] or [Bolaji Ayodeji][5]).
- Default commit messages are not welcome.
- Missing references or rewording of reused material is not welcome.
- Content should be in proper Markdown format&mdash;check the [Markdown Cheatsheet][6].
